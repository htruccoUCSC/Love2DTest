Local dev and build using Vite

- Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

- Build game and run development server (serves `web/` on http://localhost:5173):

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Run dev server on existing build (serves `web/` on http://localhost:5173):

```bash
npm run serve
```

Notes:
- `vite` is configured with `root: 'web'` so it serves the existing `web/index.html` and static assets.
